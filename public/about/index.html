        <div class="header-text">Sanctuary Institute is a community of inquisitive beings devoted to the exploration of
          the human experience
          and human potential. Engaged in research, education and interweaving creative mediums with consciousness
          studies.</div>

      <div class="collection-info">
        <p>Throughout time radical spaces such as this, have been at the center of societal development and crucial
          for the creation of new paradigms. Places like Esalen, Black Mountain, Gurdjieff’s Institute have shaped the
          edge of the sciences and arts. We aim to continue this legacy.</p>
        <p>Our practices draw on ancient knowledge systems - wisdom. With a focus on social justice and conscious
          cultivation of self. We utilise beauty and the arts as a means towards self realisation and liberation.
          Driven by our innate admiration and care for nature, we aim to create and develop an awareness for our
          fundamental interconnectedness and a collective consciousness that is grounded in experience – all the while
          creating a nourishing environment that supports another's growth, ideas and visions.</p>

        <p>Sanctuary institute is located in Yucatan, Mexico on Mayan land. It’s nature is rich and fertile, with a
          vast array of flora and fauna. A place for contemplation and adoration of nature itself. Immersed in the
          abundant Mayan jungle rests a beautiful Cenote - a deep water cave where several endangered species can be
          found. Located only an hour away from Caribbean beach paradises such as Tulum, and only 40 minutes away from
          Chichen-Itzá, one of the most important Mayan archaeological sites. </p>
